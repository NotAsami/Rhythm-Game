# [Project Name] — A 2.5D Rhythm Experience

“Feel the beat. Shape the world. Play your music.”

## Overview

[Project Name] is a 2.5D rhythm game built in Godot Engine (C#) that transforms your own music files (.mp3) into fully playable levels.
Every beat, drop, and melody dynamically shapes the gameplay.

This project is based on our good friends idea, which we chose to create into a real game!

## Key Features

**MP3-to-Level Converter** – Upload any .mp3 file, and the game automatically generates a unique playable level based on tempo and beat patterns.

**Engaging Gameplay** – Every song creates a new rhythm experience.

**Beat Detection Engine** – Uses real-time frequency and amplitude analysis to synchronize gameplay with the music.

**2.5D Gameplay** – Blends 2D mechanics with a 3D visual layer for depth and motion parallax.

## How It Works

1. Get an .mp3 file of your favorite song.
2. Drag and drop the .mp3 file into the game.
3. The game will automatically convert that file into a playable level.
5. Play!
